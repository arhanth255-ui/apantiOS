apantiOS

apantiOS is an experimental, developer-friendly operating system focused on clarity, usefulness, and long-term creativity.

The goal of apantiOS is to combine:

A simple and clean operating system for normal users

A powerful Developer Edition with advanced tools, a custom language, and creative systems

A long-term vision that connects technology with social good

apantiOS is not intended to replace existing operating systems.
It exists to explore better ways of learning, building, and creating systems from the ground up.

Vision

apantiOS is designed for two primary groups:

Normal users who want a lightweight, practical, and easy-to-use operating system

Developers and creators who want deep system access, strong tooling, and freedom to experiment

Core values:

Simplicity over complexity

Learning over shortcuts

Community over hype

Planned Editions (High-Level)
User Edition (Planned)

Clean and minimal user experience

Essential applications

Designed to be affordable and easy to use

Developer Edition (Planned)

Includes everything in the User Edition, plus:

A custom programming language and interpreter

Developer APIs and SDK

Game-making tools and a game engine

Tools for building applications, mods, and system components

All editions are planned to be built on the same core operating system.

Current Status

apantiOS is currently in the early design and prototyping stage.

Planned development phases:

Text-based OS prototype or simulator

Minimal core system

Basic shell and userland

User Edition release

Developer Edition tools (language, interpreter, engine)

Development is intentionally careful and incremental.

Architecture (Planned)

Core system: low-level components (likely C-based)

High-level logic and early tooling: Python

Modular design for future extensibility

Clear separation between the core OS and developer tools

Detailed technical planning is available in the /docs directory.

Note on the future

apantiOS is currently a community-driven and experimental project.
In the future, there may be commercial editions or paid tools built on top of the core system.

The core focus remains learning, openness, and respectful collaboration.

Documentation


Details will be shared transparently on the official website once the project reaches a mature stage.
Website name will be conveyed later.

License

License details will be finalized as development progresses.
Until then, treat this project as non-commercial and experimental unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Final Notes

apantiOS is a long-term project.

If you are interested in learning, experimentation, and building systems from the ground up, you are welcome to contribute.
